# Incorporating-Virtual-Chemical-Companies

## Overview
This project focused on identifying and developing high-value chemicals that could be efficiently produced in India. The goal was to select chemicals that were profitable, had available raw materials, and complied with environmental, health, and safety regulations. The project involved a comprehensive market analysis, R&D for chemical synthesis, technical services for process development, and ensuring compliance with EHS standards.

## Approach
1. **Identification and Screening**:
   - Screened chemicals considering profitability, availability of raw materials, and safety. Used resources like Zauba and reports from the Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers and KPMG for data collection.

2. **Market Analysis**:
   - Conducted a comprehensive market analysis to identify high-value chemicals. Gathered data on material input costs and product costs. Selected PET and TiO₂ based on their economic feasibility, potential profitability, and market demand.

3. **Development of Production Process**:
   - Developed a feasible and scalable production process for the selected chemicals. The R&D team came up with chemical reactions and separation steps. The technical services team designed a block diagram for the process, performed material balance, and identified unit operations.

4. **Compliance with EHS Regulations**:
   - Ensured the production process complied with environmental, health, and safety regulations. The EHS team identified safety concerns, estimated waste generation, and proposed plans for monitoring and treating waste.

5. **Economic Analysis**:
   - Achieved high profitability for the selected chemicals. Conducted a detailed economic analysis to determine the net Rate of Return. For PET and TiO₂, achieved returns were 83% and 47%, respectively, after deducting all production costs.

## Conclusion
This project combined technical expertise with market analysis to identify and develop high-value chemicals in India. The collaborative effort across different divisions ensured a comprehensive approach to achieving economic and environmental sustainability.
